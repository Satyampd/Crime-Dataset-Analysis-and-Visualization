# Crimes-Against-Women-in-India-2001-to-2014


Hey there, in this notebook, I tried to visualize the Crimes Against Women using the available dataset.

**In this notebook you will be able to see some insight with regards to crimes that happened against women between the year 2002 and 2014. For instance,**
1. **A graph with total number of crimes VS Years**
2. **Top 20 Districts of India with the highest number of the case reported for Crimes Against Women.**
3. **Top 5 States with Highest Number of Rapes.**
4. **Top 5 States with the Highest number of Dowry Death.**
5. **A 3D Scatter plot for top 20 Districts of India with Rape, Literacy, and Population, etc.**


Important Points(please read it):

Data is gathered from three different sources.

    Crimes against women data from Data.gov.in(CSV File)
    India 2011 Census Data from kaggle.com(CSV File)
    Literacy Data(based on Census 2011) from census2011.co.in/district.php( Data was scraped and then stored into CSV file)

As data is gathered from different sources there could be some issue, I tried my best to minimize them. For example, there was spelling difference with multiple West Bengal districts and Cyberabad is not mentioned in Census data.

Another important thing is to be noted that, the Literacy and Population data is from the 2011 India Census and is used against all years between 2001 to 2014.

Bonus Point: This notebook is made using Plotly library, you can zoom-in the graph, hover the point using the mouse to see detailed information in the cartesian plane and last 3D plot can be rotated 360 using mouse and hovering over the Scatter point will show you multiple information with that particular point.
