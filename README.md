# Crimes-Against-Women-in-India-2001-to-2014


Hey there, in this notebook, I tried to visualize the Crimes Against Women using the available dataset.

**In this notebook you will be able to see some insight with regards to crimes that happened against women between the year 2002 and 2014. For instance,**
1. **A graph with total number of crimes VS Years**
2. **Top 20 Districts of India with the highest number of the case reported for Crimes Against Women.**
3. **Top States with Highest Number of Rapes.**
4. **Top States with the Highest number of Dowry Death.**
5. **A 3D Scatter plot for top 20 Districts of India with Rape, Literacy, and Population, etc.**

**Disclaimer(please read it):**

This analysis and visualization is only for educational purposes, use of below
graphs and analysis is strictly prohibited in any official or political work.

Reason: Data is not well organised, dataset has various issues.In case of any
query/issue, please connect through provided username in Footer! 

Brief:Data is gathered from three different sources.

Crimes against women data from Data.gov.in(CSV File)
India 2011 Census Data from kaggle.com(CSV File)
Literacy Data(based on Census 2011) from census2011.co.in/district.php(Data 
was scraped and then stored into CSV file).

As data is gathered from different sources there are some issues, I tried my best 
to minimize them. For example, there were spelling differences with multiple 
West Bengal districts and Cyberabad is notmentioned in Census data.Another important
thing is to be noted that the Literacy and Population data isfrom the 2011 India
Census and is used against all years between 2001 to 2014.

**Bonus Point: This notebook is made using Plotly library, you can zoom-in the graph,
hover the point using the mouse to see detailed information in the cartesian
planeand last 3D plot can be rotated 360 using mouse and hovering over the Scatter
point will show you multiple information with that particular point**
